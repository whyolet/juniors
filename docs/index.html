      <h2>Pain</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of junior professionals who cannot find a job
        because they need to have years of experience to get a job
        but they cannot get this experience without having a job.
      </p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <p>
        To break this vicious "chicken-and-egg" circle,
        juniors spend their time and money on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>educational courses,</li>
        <li>portfolio building,</li>
        <li>small side projects,</li>
        <li>and so on...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...to just get another "oh, so you don't have years of real experience"
        verdict at the interview.
      </p>

      <h3>Internship</h3>
      <p>
        An internship could be a good solution:
        a company does not pay an intern, exchanging labor for experience.
        However, a company still pays for the mentor's time spent on guidance.
        Even a technically skilled junior still needs guidance...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...so juniors hear "oh, we like you,
        but we don't have mentors available at the moment".
      </p>

      <h3>Situation</h3>
      <p>
        As the labor market is clearly oversaturated with candidates,
        including mid- and senior-level ones,
        it becomes almost impossible for a junior to get a job,
        even an unpaid internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        For UI/UX and QA, this is almost impossible,
        as some enterprising people tried to romanticize entry into the IT field
        and high earnings from the start,
        and numerous courses produced a huge number of junior designers and testers.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the only way for them to survive is to take off their rose-colored glasses
        and start getting a real job, not paying for even more courses.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        What if juniors could pay companies
        to at least partially compensate the time
        spent by mentors to guide juniors?
      </p>
      <p>
        That could increase the motivation of companies
        to provide internship opportunities.
        It could also increase the motivation of juniors
        to learn quickly to pay less for the mentor's time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost a junior has to pay to get a job
        is determined in an interview based on skills, portfolio,
        and competition for the mentors available.
        Some juniors could even get a scholarship that covers some or all of the cost.
        For others, this model may open up an opportunity
        where previously the company would have had to say no.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the junior or the company is not satisfied with the progress,
        they can terminate the contract by giving one month's notice.
      </p>
      <p>Example of payments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st month: a junior pays $100 to a company.</li>
        <li>2nd month: nobody pays - labor for experience.</li>
        <li>3rd month: a company pays $300 to a junior.</li>
        <li>10th month: a company pays $1000 to a junior</li>
        <li>50th month: a company pays $5000 to a middle.</li>
        <li>100th month: a company pays $10000 to a senior.</li>
      </ul>
