      <h2>Pain</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of junior professionals who cannot find a job
        because they need to have years of experience to get a job
        but they cannot get this experience without having a job.
      </p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <p>
        To break this vicious "chicken-and-egg" circle,
        juniors spend their time and money on:
        <ul>
          <li>educational courses,</li>
          <li>creating portfolios,</li>
          <li>small side projects,</li>
          <li>and so on...</li>
        </ul>
        ...to just get another "oh, so you don't have years of real experience"
        verdict on the interview.
      </p>

      <h3>Internship</h3>
      <p>
        Internship could be a good solution:
        a company does not pay an intern, exchanging labor for experience.
        However, a company still pays for the mentor's time spent on guidance.
        Even a technically skilled junior still needs guidance...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...so juniors hear "oh, we like you,
        but we don't have mentors available at the moment".
      </p>
      <p>
        As the job market is clearly oversaturated with candidates,
        including the middle and senior level ones,
        it becomes almost impossible for a junior to get a job,
        even unpaid internship.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        What if juniors could pay companies
        to at least partially compensate the time
        spent by mentors to guide juniors?
      </p>
      <p>
        That could increase the motivation of companies
        to provide internship opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could also increase the motivation of juniors
        to learn fast and spend less time with mentors.
      </p>
      <p>Example of payments:
        <ul>
          <li>1st month: a junior pays $100 to a company.</li>
          <li>2nd month: nobody pays - labor for experience.</li>
          <li>3rd month: a company pays $300 to a junior.</li>
          <li>10th month: a company pays $1000 to a junior</li>
          <li>50th month: a company pays $5000 to a middle.</li>
          <li>100th month: a company pays $10000 to a senior.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
